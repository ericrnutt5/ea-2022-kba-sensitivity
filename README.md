# Purpose of the project
Systematic Conservation Planning is a field of research that uses GIS and Python for spatial analysis, with the purpose of strategically identifying areas that meet a given conservation goal.

Scientists bring together collected data from a variety of biological and ecological sources and execute an iterative workflow to define areas that successfully meet the required criteria. These data sources can include:

* species populations,
* vegetative land cover,
* nesting sites,
* seasonal feeding patterns
* or even the location of historic cultural heritage sites.

We will perform a sensitivity analysis of the current thresholds set by the IUCN, looking to see what KBAs can be found for each ecosystem type at 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% of the current thresholds. Results of the analysis are shared with key stakeholders and decision makers, enabling them to efficiently direct limited resources towards solutions with the lowest cost and greatest chance for long term ecological success.

Another factor we will look at is the natural spatial pattern of each ecosystem type (linear, patchy or matrix-forming), and how that pattern may affect how KBAs are identified.

Perhaps a lower threshold would more effectively trigger KBA identification in linear ecosystems, such as those found along rivers and coasts. If so, spatial pattern might be a characteristic to be included in future IUCN Guidelines.

# Installation instructions
### Installation of earth analytics python environment
We are using earth-analytics-enviornment provided and maintained by Earth Lab, University of Colorado. Please follow this [link](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/) for installation instructions.

### Installation of marxanconpy python package:
*

# Required Tools and Packages
* ArcGIS and ArcMarxan Toolbox, Version 2.0.2; Available at https://aproposinfosystems.com/
* and/or QGIS and QMarxan Toolbox, Version 2.0.1
* matplotlib
* numpy
* geopandas
* xarray
* rioxarray

# Data
* Raster dataset featuring US ecosystems at 30 m spatial resolution, provided by NatureServe.
* Shapefile with a network of 7 sq. mile hexagons covering North America, also provided by NatureServe.
* Processed shapefiles for each indiviadual ecosystem, contain network of hexes showing spatial distribution of an ecosystem, unique hex IDs, and quantity of raster cells (of the initial dataset) which got a hexagon overlaps.

# Data Storage
* EDIT TO INCLUDE NEW FOLDER WHEN ADDED Currently data is stored in our shared Google Drive. User will have to download data and save it in earth-analytics/data/natureserve
